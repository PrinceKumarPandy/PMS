A Project Management System using Python with GUI is a software application designed to help users organize, track, and manage projects and tasks through an easy-to-use visual interface. Python, known for its clear syntax and rich ecosystem, is commonly used to build such systems. For the GUI (Graphical User Interface), libraries like Tkinter are popular choices due to their accessibility and integration with Python.

Core Features:

Project and Task Management: Users can create new projects, add tasks under each project, set due dates, and assign priorities or statuses (such as pending/completed).

User Interface (GUI): The application presents interactive windows, forms, buttons, lists, and dialogs, allowing users to navigate and manage projects visually. Tkinter is often used for this purpose, supporting widgets like buttons, forms, menus, and list/tree views.

CRUD Operations: The system enables Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities for both projects and tasks. For example, users can add or remove projects, update task details, and mark tasks as completed.
